This repository contains the PDF of my Bachelor thesis in Computer Science.

The work focuses on the modeling, simulation, and detection of covert timing
channels in IEEE 802.11 MAC (DCF), using probabilistic and information-theoretic
metrics.

The original simulation code was developed during the project but is no longer
available. This repository therefore serves as a reference to the research and
methodology through the thesis document itself.
